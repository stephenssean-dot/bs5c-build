# BeoSound 5c

A modern recreation of the Bang & Olufsen BeoSound 5 experience using web technologies and a Raspberry Pi 5.

**Website: [www.beosound5c.com](https://www.beosound5c.com)**

This project replaces the original BeoSound 5 software with a circular arc-based touch UI that integrates with Sonos players, music services (Spotify, Apple Music, TIDAL, Plex), and Home Assistant. It works with the original BS5 hardware (rotary encoder, laser pointer, display) and supports BeoRemote One for wireless control.

I built this for my own setup, but it runs daily on multiple BeoSound 5 units. Your setup may require some configuration — particularly for Home Assistant integration.

## Quick Start

### Try Without Hardware (Emulator Mode)

The web interface includes built-in hardware emulation using keyboard and mouse/trackpad:

```bash
# Start web server
cd web && python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open http://localhost:8000
```

The UI works fully without any backend services. Hardware input is simulated with keyboard and mouse.

**Controls:**
- Laser pointer: Mouse wheel / trackpad scroll
- Navigation wheel: Arrow Up/Down
- Volume: PageUp/PageDown or +/-
- Buttons: Arrow Left/Right, Enter

**Optional — Sonos artwork and metadata (in a second terminal):**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install soco pillow websockets aiohttp
cd services && python3 players/sonos.py
```

Set your Sonos speaker IP in `config/default.json` under `player.ip` before starting the service.

### Install on Raspberry Pi 5

Tested on [Raspberry Pi 5 8GB](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/), but lower RAM versions should work fine.

1. Flash **Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm Lite (64-bit)** using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). Click the settings icon (gear) to enable SSH and set your username/password before writing.
2. Clone and run the installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mkirsten/beosound5c.git ~/beosound5c
cd ~/beosound5c
sudo ./install/install.sh
```

The installer handles everything: packages, USB permissions, display config, service installation, configuration prompts, and optional BeoRemote One pairing. It will ask if you want to reboot when complete.

## Configuration

Configuration lives in two files on the device:

- **`/etc/beosound5c/config.json`** — all settings (device name, Sonos IP, menu, scenes, volume, transport)
- **`/etc/beosound5c/secrets.env`** — credentials only (HA token, MQTT password)

The installer creates both during setup. To reconfigure: edit `/etc/beosound5c/config.json`, then `sudo systemctl restart beo-*`.

### config.json

The installer creates this interactively during setup. Here's a minimal example:

```json
{
  "device": "Living Room",

  "menu": {
    "PLAYING": "playing",
    "SPOTIFY": "spotify",
    "APPLE MUSIC": "apple_music",
    "TIDAL": "tidal",
    "PLEX": "plex",
    "SCENES": "scenes",
    "SYSTEM": "system"
  },

  "scenes": [
    { "id": "dinner", "name": "Dinner", "icon": "fork-knife", "color": "#fa0" },
    { "id": "all_off", "name": "All off", "icon": "power", "color": "#c55" }
  ],

  "player": { "type": "sonos", "ip": "192.168.1.100" },
  "bluetooth": { "remote_mac": "" },
  "home_assistant": {
    "url": "http://homeassistant.local:8123",
    "webhook_url": "http://homeassistant.local:8123/api/webhook/beosound5c"
  },
  "transport": { "mode": "mqtt", "mqtt_broker": "homeassistant.local" },
  "volume": {
    "type": "sonos",
    "host": "192.168.1.100",
    "max": 70,
    "step": 3,
    "output_name": "Sonos"
  },
  "spotify": { "client_id": "" }
}
```

For the full list of fields, volume adapter types, menu item options, and scene configuration, see the **[config schema](docs/config.schema.json)**.

### secrets.env

Credentials live separately in `/etc/beosound5c/secrets.env` (created by the installer). See [`config/secrets.env.example`](config/secrets.env.example) for the template.

## Audio

Each BS5c is configured with one **player** (Sonos, BlueSound, or Local) and one **volume adapter** (which controls the physical volume). The installer asks you to choose during setup.

### Player Types

| Player | Capabilities | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| Sonos | `spotify`, `url_stream` | Any Sonos speaker (S1 or S2, any generation) |
| BlueSound | `url_stream` | Any BluOS player (e.g. Node, PowerNode, Vault) |
| Local | `url_stream` | S/PDIF HAT, HDMI, or other audio output |

### Source Compatibility

Sources check the player's capabilities at startup to determine how to play content. Sources that play locally (CD, USB) work with any player type.

| Source | Sonos | BlueSound | Local player |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spotify | Yes (ShareLink) | No | Possible (needs librespot) |
| Apple Music | Yes (ShareLink) | No | Not feasible (Apple DRM) |
| TIDAL | Yes (ShareLink) | Yes (stream URL) | Possible (stream URLs exist) |
| Plex | Yes (stream URL) | Yes (stream URL) | Yes (stream URL) |
| CD | Yes (plays locally) | Yes (plays locally) | Yes |
| USB | Yes (streams URLs) | Yes (streams URLs) | Yes |

Spotify and Apple Music send share links via `uri=` which only Sonos handles (via ShareLink). TIDAL and Plex send direct stream URLs via `url=` which both players support. On Sonos, TIDAL uses ShareLink for native queue management; on BlueSound, TIDAL resolves stream URLs and manages the queue itself (like Plex).

### Volume Adapters

| Adapter | Controls | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| Sonos | Sonos speaker volume | Sonos player configured |
| BlueSound | BluOS player volume | BlueSound player configured |
| BeoLab 5 | BeoLab 5 via sync port | BeoLab 5 Controller |
| PowerLink | B&O PowerLink speakers | S/PDIF HAT with COAX output |
| HDMI | ALSA software volume on HDMI1 | Amplifier with HDMI audio input |
| S/PDIF | ALSA software volume | S/PDIF HAT (e.g. HiFiBerry Digi) |
| RCA | ALSA software volume | DAC HAT with RCA out |

Sources register with the router and appear in the menu. The remote's media keys are forwarded to whichever source is currently active. When no source is active, transport keys (play/pause/next/prev) are forwarded directly to the player.

For details on each output, playback modes, and volume adapter configuration, see **[Audio Setup Options](docs/audio-setup.md)**.

## Home Assistant Integration

BeoSound 5c communicates with Home Assistant via **MQTT** (recommended) or **HTTP webhooks**. The transport is configured via `transport.mode` in `config.json`. The installer will prompt you to choose.

### MQTT Setup (recommended)

Requires an MQTT broker — the [Mosquitto add-on](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/tree/master/mosquitto) works well. Create a user for the BS5c in the add-on config, then set `transport.mode` to `"mqtt"` in `config.json` with your broker hostname. MQTT credentials go in `secrets.env`.

MQTT topics use the pattern `beosound5c/{device}/out|in|status`:

```
beosound5c/living_room/out      → BS5c sends button events to HA
beosound5c/living_room/in       → HA sends commands to BS5c
beosound5c/living_room/status   → Online/offline (retained)
```

Example HA automation trigger:
```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: mqtt
    topic: "beosound5c/living_room/out"
```

Example HA command to BS5c:
```yaml
action:
  - action: mqtt.publish
    data:
      topic: "beosound5c/living_room/in"
      payload: '{"command": "wake", "params": {"page": "now_playing"}}'
```

### HA Configuration

Add to `configuration.yaml` (needed for the embedded Security page):

```yaml
http:
  cors_allowed_origins:
    - "http://<BEOSOUND5C_IP>:8000"
  use_x_frame_options: false

homeassistant:
  auth_providers:
    - type: trusted_networks
      trusted_networks:
        - <BEOSOUND5C_IP>
      allow_bypass_login: true
    - type: homeassistant
```

**Security note**: These settings allow the BeoSound 5c to embed Home Assistant pages without authentication. Only add IPs you trust to `trusted_networks` and `cors_allowed_origins`. This is intended for devices on your local network.

See [`config/homeassistant/example-automation.yaml`](config/homeassistant/example-automation.yaml) for complete automation examples covering both MQTT and webhook transports.

See [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines.

## Development

### Repo Layout

```
config/
├── default.json          # Fallback for local development
├── <device>.json         # Per-device config (gitignored)
└── secrets.env.example   # Credentials template
```

For multi-device setups, create a JSON file per device in `config/` (e.g. `config/living-room.json`). The deploy script copies the matching config to `/etc/beosound5c/config.json` on the target.

### Deploying Updates

```bash
# Sync files and restart services
./deploy.sh                    # default: beo-http + beo-ui
./deploy.sh beo-player-sonos   # restart a specific service
./deploy.sh beo-*              # restart all beo services
./deploy.sh --no-restart       # sync files only

# Target a specific device
BEOSOUND5C_HOSTS="my-device.local" ./deploy.sh
```
